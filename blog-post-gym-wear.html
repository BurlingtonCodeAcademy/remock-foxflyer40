                        Sweet wonderful you,
                        You make me happy with the things you do.
                        Oh, can it be so?
                        This feeling follows me wherever I go.

                        I never did believe in miracles,
                        But I've a feeling it's time to try.
                        I never did believe in the ways of magic,
                        But I'm beginning to wonder why.

                        Don't, don't break the spell.
                        It would be different, and you know it will.
                        You, you make loving fun,
                        And I don't have to tell you, but you're the only one.

                        Rock on, gold dust woman
                        Take your silver spoon and dig your grave

                        Heartless challenge
                        Pick your path and I'll pray

                        Wake up in the morning
                        See your sunrise loves to go down

                        Lousy lovers pick their prey
                        But they never cry out loud, cry out

                        Well, did she make you cry
                        Make you break down
                        Shatter your illusions of love?
                        And is it over now?
                        Do you know how?
                        Pick up the pieces and go home

                        Rock on, ancient queen
                        Follow those who pale in your shadow

                        Rulers make bad lovers
                        You better put your kingdom up for sale, up for sale

                        Well, did she make you cry
                        Make you break down
                        Shatter your illusions of love?
                        And is it over now?
                        Do you know how?
                        Pick up the pieces and go home

                        Well, did she make you cry
                        Make you break down
                        Shatter your illusions of love?
                        And now tell me is it over now?
                        Do you know how?
                        Pick up the pieces and go home
                        Go home
                        Go home

                        Ooh, pale shadow of a woman
                        Black widow
                        Pale shadow of a dragon
                        Dust woman

                        Ooh, pale shadow of a woman
                        Black widow
                        Ooh, pale shadow, she's a dragon
