            <div class="lmpText">T'ain't no big thing
               To wait for the bell to ring
               T'ain't no big thing
               The toll of the bell
               Aggravated - spare for days
               I troll downtown the red light place
               Jump up bubble up - what's in store
               Love is the drug and I need to score
               Showing out, showing out, hit and run
               Boy meets girl where the beat goes on
               Stitched up tight, can't shake free
               Love is the drug, got a hook on me
               Oh oh catch that buzz
               Love is the drug I'm thinking of
               Oh oh can't you see
               Love is the drug for me
               Late that night I park my car
               Stake my place in the singles bar
               Face to face, toe to toe
               Heart to heart as we hit the floor
               Lumber up, limbo down
               The locked embrace, the stumble round
               I say go, she say yes
               Dim the lights, you can guess the rest
               Oh oh catch that buzz
               Love is the drug I'm thinking of
               Oh oh can't you see
               Love is the drug, got a hook in me
               Oh oh catch that buzz
               Love is the drug I'm thinking of
               Oh oh can't you see
               Love is the drug for me

               Hello
               Is there anybody in there?
               Just nod if you can hear me
               Is there anyone at home?

               Come on now
               I hear you're feeling down
               Well, I can ease your pain
               Get you on your feet again

               Relax
               I'll need some information first
               Just the basic facts
               Can you show me where it hurts?

               There is no pain, you are receding
               A distant ship smoke on the horizon
               You are only coming through in waves
               Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
               When I was a child I had a fever
               My hands felt just like two balloons
               Now I've got that feeling once again
               I can't explain, you would not understand
               This is not how I am
               I have become comfortably numb

               I have become comfortably numb

               O.K.
               Just a little pin prick
               There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!
               But you may feel a little sick

               Can you stand up?
               I do believe it's working, good
               That'll keep you going through the show
               Come on, it's time to go

               There is no pain you are receding
               A distant ship smoke on the horizon
               You are only coming through in waves
               Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
               When I was a child
               I caught a fleeting glimpse
               Out of the corner of my eye
               I turned to look but it was gone
               I cannot put my finger on it now
               The child is grown
               The dream is gone
               I have become comfortably numb
