                        Money, it's a gas
                        Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash

                        I'm all right, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack.
                        Money, it's a hit
                        Don't give me that do goody good bullshit

                        And I think I need a Learjet

                        Money, it's a crime
                        Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie
                        Money, so they say
                        Is the root of all evil today
                        But if you ask for a rise it's no surprise that they're giving none away

                        "Yeah!"
                        "Why does anyone do anything?"

                        coming up on freight eleven. After, I was yelling and screaming and telling him why it wasn't
                        coming up on freight eleven. It came to a heavy blow, which sorted the matter out."
                        The lunatic is on the grass
                        The lunatic is on the grass
                        Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs
                        Got to keep the loonies on the path

                        The lunatic is in the hall
                        The lunatics are in my hall
                        The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
                        And every day the paper boy brings more

                        And if the dam breaks open many years too soon
                        And if there is no room upon the hill
                        And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
                        I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

                        The lunatic is in my head
                        The lunatic is in my head
                        You raise the blade, you make the change
                        You re-arrange me 'til I'm sane

                        You lock the door and throw away the key
                        There's someone in my head but it's not me.

                        And if the cloud bursts thunder in your ear
                        You shout and no one seems to hear
                        And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
                        I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

                        I can't think of anything to say except...
                        I think it's marvelous! Ha, ha, ha!
