                        There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
                        And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
                        &nbsp&nbsp
                        When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
                        With a word she can get what she came for.
                        &nbsp&nbsp
                        Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.
                        &nbsp&nbsp
                        There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
                        'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
                        &nbsp&nbsp
                        In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,
                        Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.
                        <br>
                        Ooh, it makes me wonder,
                        <br>
                        Ooh, it makes me wonder.
                        <br>
                        There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,
                        And my spirit is crying for leaving.
                        &nbsp&nbsp
                        In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,
                        And the voices of those who stand looking.
                        <br> Ooh, it makes me wonder,
                        <br>
                        Ooh, it really makes me wonder.
                        <br>
                        And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune,
                        Then the piper will lead us to reason.
                        &nbsp&nbsp
                        And a new day will dawn for those who stand long,
                        And the forests will echo with laughter.
                        &nbsp&nbsp
                        If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,
                        It's just a spring clean for the May queen.
                        &nbsp&nbsp
                        Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
                        There's still time to change the road you're on.
                        <br>
                        And it makes me wonder.
                        <br>
                        Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,
                        The piper's calling you to join him,
                        &nbsp&nbsp
                        Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
                        Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?
                        <br>
                        And as we wind on down the road
                        &nbsp&nbsp
                        Our shadows taller than our soul.
                        &nbsp&nbsp
                        There walks a lady we all know
                        &nbsp&nbsp
                        Who shines white light and wants to show
                        &nbsp&nbsp
                        How everything still turns to gold.
                        &nbsp&nbsp
                        And if you listen very hard
                        &nbsp&nbsp
                        The tune will come to you at last.
                        &nbsp&nbsp
                        When all are one and one is all
                        &nbsp&nbsp
                        To be a rock and not to roll.
                        <br>
                        And she's buying a stairway to heaven.
