                        river. We are the Priests of the
                        Temples of Syrinx. He leads me on, light years away through astral nights, galactic days.
                        Well-weathered leather, hot metal and oil, the scented country air. Concert hall echoes with the
                        sounds of salesmen.
                        Listen to my music and hear what it can do.
                        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                        Just think about the average. What use have they for you? The world is. The world is. Love and
                        life are deep. Maybe as his skies are wide.
                        Behind my beloved waterfall, in the little room that was hidden beneath the cave, I found it.
                        Our great computers fill the hallowed halls. Drive like the wind , straining the limits of
                        machine and man. But the Oaks can't help their feelings, if they like the way they're made, and
                        they wonder why the Maples can't be happy in their shade? To keep it as new has been his dearest
                        dream.

                        Attention all Planets of the Solar
                        Federation, we have assumed control. Living on a
                        lighted stage approaches the unreal for those who think and feel in touch with some reality
                        beyond the gilded cage.</div>

                        relax their restless flight. The world is. The world is. Love and life are deep. Maybe as his
                        skies are wide. Our books, our music, our work and play are all looked after by the benevolent
                        wisdom of the priests... Escape to realms beyond the night, dream - can't you show me the light?
                        There is magic at your fingers for the Spirit ever lingers dndemanding contact on your happy
                        solitude. The Priests praise my name on this night. Growing up it all seems so one-sided,
                        opinions all provided, the future pre-decided, detached and subdivided in the mass production
                        zone. Jump to the ground as the Turbo slows to cross the borderline.

                        Down in his barn, my uncle
                        preserved for me an old machine - for fifty-odd years. In the sudden silence as I finished
                        playing, I looked up to a circle of grim, expressionless faces. I watched in shock and horror as Father Brown ground my precious instrument to
                        splinters beneath his feet... Yes, we know. It's nothing new. It's just a waste of time.
                        <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                        The sleep is still in my eyes.When I touch it, it gives forth a sound. I thought that you should
                        know. Forget about
                        your silly whim. It doesn't fit the plan. The massive grey walls of the Temples rise from the
                        Heart of every Federation city.</div>
